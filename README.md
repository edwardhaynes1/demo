# dial
_A simple dialer programme_

- A visual dialler interface in javafx records an user-input ten-digit phone number, which is then confirmed with a dial button.
- The imput ten-digit number is then printed on screen.
- When the user confirms that the number is correct the programme ends. 
- If the user tries to dial a number that is too short, the user is alerted that that number is incorrect and asked to dial again.
